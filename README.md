My submission for the [Spring 2023 49-hour game jam](https://itch.io/jam/2023-spring-game-jam)

I made this project to test out implementations for rhythm games. While this game itself is quite simple (and admittedly boring), it was a good way to experiment with accuracy detection and rhythm game elements.

I find rhythm games interesting because, unlike most other genres, all game code is based on timing and input, rather than collision boxes and physics. The only thing I needed the game engine for was the user input, music, and graphics.
